      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br />
      <p align="justify">
        As a tech sales professional with 10 years of experience, I excel in
        building strong client relationships and driving revenue growth. I am
        thrilled to transition into a full-stack engineer role where I can apply
        my passion for technology and problem-solving skills to create
        innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        I have developed programming skills in HTML and CSS through self-study
        and hands-on coding projects. I thrive in fast-paced environments,
        collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams, and continuously
        challenge myself to learn and grow. Let's connect to discuss how my
        sales experience and emerging technical skills can drive digital
        transformation and deliver high-quality software solutions. During my
        time at Revel Systems, I had the opportunity to become a project manager
        for large enterprise clients.

      <p align="justify">
        I was tasked with selling technologies like APIs and XML code
        reconfiguration, despite having little prior knowledge about them.
        However, I embraced the challenge and achieved great success. This
        experience has fueled my curiosity about the diverse world of coding,
        and it ultimately led me to take the plunge into becoming a full-stack
        engineer. Combining my sales experience with my emerging technical
        skills, I aspire to leverage my background in building client
        relationships and driving revenue growth to contribute to the digital
        transformation of organizations. I am eager to apply my expertise in
        software development, alongside my passion for technology and
        problem-solving, to create innovative solutions that meet the evolving
        needs of customers.
